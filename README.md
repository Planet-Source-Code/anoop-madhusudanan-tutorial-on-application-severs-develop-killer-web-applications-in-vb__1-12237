<p><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">Dear Friends,</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">Kindly see the attached ZIP for the article and associated projects. Anyway, here is a short introduction. As you know, now a days, the term <b>Application
Server</b> is becoming so hot. </font><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">An Application Server
is a software that runs on the middle layer. I mean; it runs between a thin front end (in this case the web browser) and
back end servers.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">Most Application Servers rely on Internet Servers, to pass
information/data to clients on the web. Application Servers are expected to support COM (Component Object Model) and/or CORBA (Common
Object Request Broker Architecture) frameworks.<br>
<br>
In this case, we are creating an Application Server that supports COM interface.
After reading this, you can</font></p>
<ul>
 <li><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">Get an idea about Application Servers.</font></li>
 <li><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">Create and use your own COM based Application Servers.</font></li>
 <li><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">Write directly to RESPONSE object from
 a COM component (Got it? Instead of passing a value back to a variable in ASP to write it to response object, write
 directly to response object from your component)</font></li>
 <li><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">See how to integrate additional logic (say your existing
 business COM objects) using our Application Server</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="verdana,arial" size="1">Also, if you are the CEO of an IT/Web
company, don't forget to read about my ventures in the preface section
:-).  OOPS, forgot to tell all of you one thing; VOTE for me please,
because I took nearly 6-7 hours to write this completely :-) (ofcourse, the brain work is extra.lol.)</font></p>
